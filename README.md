# Plug-Panel-Generator
This is a Javascript plug panel for visualization of source and destination data inputs. Made to simmulate audio equipment, it currently doesn't have function binding capabilities; it's mostly just visual, but at some point in the future I'll add a function binding mechanism. Enjoy!
